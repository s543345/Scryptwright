# Development Process
## Backlog
The **backlog** is the primary method of tracking what work we are completing.
- **Tasks** (issues in the tracker) are added as we identify work that needs to be completed.
- **Labels** are assigned to a task to indicate what feature it is being developed for.
- **Assignees** tell us who is working on a given task.
- **Size** is a _guideline_ for how much work the task will require.
- **Priority** helps us organize what tasks get done when.

When making a task, the description will note what work needs to get done.

For some tasks, we'll split it into several smaller tasks to assign to individual people. The **main** task is used as an objective; as subtasks are complete, add a comment to the main task noting what has been accomplished. We'll close the main task once all subtasks are done.

## Priority Board
The **priority board** is a useful second view to visualize the work we have to do.

## Roadmap
The **roadmap** is a view that lets us see when tasks are scheduled to be complete. Update the roadmap as your tasks demand it; please send an announcement if your tasks are running over the schedule. The schedule is naive, so it'll probably happen. Try to align your schedule tasks with their **size**.

## My Items
This view lets you see what tasks you are assigned. Use it to manage your work.
